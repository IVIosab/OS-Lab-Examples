##The race condition occurs because:

* Both threads access the shared variable `counter` simultaneously without any synchronization mechanisms.
* `counter++` is not atomic, meaning it involves multiple steps, which can be interleaved between threads.
* The threads are "racing" to update `counter`, and the result depends on the timing of the thread execution, which is nondeterministic.
